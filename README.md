# The first edition of the GGOSSS (Cameroon, 2025)

<div align=justify>
  
The inaugural summer school will take place at the Faculty of Sciences of the University of Dschang in Cameroon from August 25-29, 2025. Situated in a highland region, this unique setting reflects GGOSSS’s commitment to expanding ocean science education beyond traditional coastal and urban areas. Hosting the event in Dschang reflects an effort to foster broader interest in ocean sciences and raise awareness of the oceans' critical role in climate dynamics—a crucial yet often overlooked aspect of understanding and addressing climate change. Applications are open.
